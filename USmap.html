						<h2>Measles cases in the US by state</h2>
						<p>The debate and status quo regarding vaccine coverage and exemptions</p>
					</header>

					<p>By receiving the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine an individual does not just protect themselves against measles, they are also prevented from transmitting the disease to other people. Due to this indirect protection, a population can be effectively protected against an infectious disease even if not all of its members have been vaccinated. This is known as herd immunity and it is crucial for the protection of individuals who cannot (yet) receive the vaccine, such as babies, individuals with immune-suppressing diseases and people with vaccine allergies. The threshold for herd immunity is about a 95% vaccine coverage rate.</p>

					<p>US state laws require children to have certain vaccines as a prerequisite for entry into daycare and kindergarden. All 50 state allow for medical exemptions from this requirement. Most states (45 and Washington DC) also grant religious exemptions and 15 states allow philosophical exemptions based on other non-religous personal or moral belief. The recent US measles outbreaks have ignited a debate about whether such vaccine exemptions ought to be abolished or at least restricted. </p>

					<p>Most US states do not break down their vaccine exemption statistics by type of vaccine. Therefore, the data in the second visualization only approximates MMR vaccine exemption rates. However, given that the MMR vaccine has historially been particularly controversial, it appears reasonable to assume that many parents seeking vaccine exemptions for their children will include the MMR vaccine within the exemption. However, even with this assumption the visualization shows that in most states vaccine exemptions cannot explain the entirely shortfall in MMR coverage, suggesting that the cause of shortfalls is not just vaccine exemptions but also simply inertia, oversights and lack of knowledge. </p>
