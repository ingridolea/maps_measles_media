						<h2>2019 saw a surge in measles cases in the US</h2>
						<p>Check out how outbreaks unfolded in different states during 2019</p>
					</header>
					<p> The World Health Organization defines "elimination" of an infectious disases as "the absence of endemic virus transmission in a dfined geographical area (e.g. a region or country) for at least 12 months in the presence of a surveillance system that has been verified to be performing well". In practice, this means that a country is measles-free if the disease is no longer constantly present in the country, although there may be occasional outbreaks. Measles was declared elimintated in the US in 2000. But the surge in US measles cases in 2019 almost cost the country its measles elimination status.&nbsp<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/elimination.html"> Learn more here.</a></p>
					

					<h3>The measles outbreak in New York City has the driving force in the surge in measles cases</h3>

New York City data is separate from New York State due to exceptional numbers of cases. Based on data from the&nbsp<a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nndss-table-1v-malaria-to-measles-imported-74ebc">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a> Visualization adapted from&nbsp</i><a href="https://bl.ocks.org/jrzief/70f1f8a5d066a286da3a1e699823470f">D3 block by Joel Zief.</a> </i> </p>

					<h2>Media insight: What's with NYC?</h2>
					<p>The <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/409-19/mayor-de-blasio-health-officials-declare-end-measles-outbreak-new-york-city">2019 New York measles outbreak</a> was a series of measles cases immersed in considerable dialogue around public health, religious freedom, and vaccine hesitancy. The combination of a high concentration of people who chose to remain unvaccinated for religious reasons and the population density of New York City sparked heated controversy regarding the ethics of vaccine exemptions. In April of 2019 New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio declared a public health emergency, requiring everyone over six months old in the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Borough Park to be vaccinated. The New York City Health Department finally declared the outbreak to be over in September of 2019.</p>
