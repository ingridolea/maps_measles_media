					<p>The Maps, Measles, and Media team would like to thank Professor Dhrumil Mehta for his help and for inspiring us to enter policymaking and life not just as consumers, but as producers:</p>

					<blockquote>In the extreme, consumerism is a form of learned helplessness. In consumer culture, making is something we've forgotten we can do. It has pushed us from the mainstream to the margins. However, there's something else available: We can see ourselves as producers. In maker culture, we define ourselves based on what we can do, and what we can learn to do.
